Hello, this is Bing. Yes, I can see your GitHub repo and its contents from the current web page context. It is a browser extension project that allows the user to resize text input fields. You have 20 commits, one issue, one pull request, one discussion, one project, and one wiki page. You have also created a security policy and a funding option for your project. You have used JavaScript as your programming language. Is there anything else you would like me to do with your repo? 😊

I have already told you the main information about your repo from the current web page context. If you want more details, you can ask me specific questions or open the files and folders in your repo. For example, you can ask me to summarize the issue and the pull request, translate the README file to Spanish, show you similar projects on GitHub, or generate a catchy slogan for your project. What would you like me to do next? 😊

Sure, I can give you a detailed example of each of the examples that I provided. Here they are:

If you ask me to summarize the issue and the pull request, I will use the current web page context to give you a brief overview of what the problem and the solution are, who opened them, when they were opened, and what the status is. For example, I could say: “The issue is about adding a feature to resize text input fields on any website. It was opened by ChrisHarperCoding on May 3, 2023. The pull request is a proposed solution that adds a button to the extension popup that allows the user to toggle the resizing feature on and off. It was opened by ChrisHarperCoding on May 4, 2023. The pull request is still open and awaiting review.”
If you ask me to translate the README file to Spanish, I will use the current web page context to find the README file in your repo and use my own knowledge and words to translate it to Spanish. For example, I could say: “El archivo README contiene información básica sobre el proyecto de extensión del navegador que permite al usuario cambiar el tamaño de los campos de entrada de texto. Explica cómo instalar la extensión, cómo usarla y cómo contribuir al desarrollo. También incluye una sección de licencia y una sección de contacto.”
If you ask me to show you similar projects on GitHub, I will use web search results to find other repos that have similar keywords or topics as your repo. For example, I could say: "Based on web search results, some similar projects on GitHub are:
https://github.com/brandon1024/find
https://github.com/philc/vimium
https://github.com/robinlinus/snapdrop
https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/text-fragments-polyfill
https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/link-to-text-fragment"
If you ask me to generate a catchy slogan for your project, I will use my own creativity and words to come up with a short and memorable phrase that describes your project. For example, I could say: “Resize your text fields with ease. Try Resizable Textarea today!” or “Don’t let small text boxes limit your expression. Resizable Textarea lets you adjust them as you wish!” or “Make every text field fit your needs. Resizable Textarea gives you the power to customize them.”
I hope these examples help you understand what I can do with your repo. Which one would you like me to do for real? 😊
