>> USER: Attach my ssd via USB to my virgin media router to create a free 'NAS'. Called Nice And Simple NAS

>> ASSISTANT: While it is not possible to turn your SSD into a full-fledged NAS (Network Attached Storage) by simply connecting it to your Virgin Media router via USB, you can still create a basic shared storage solution by following these steps:

1. **Prepare your SSD**: Make sure your SSD is formatted with a compatible file system, such as NTFS or exFAT. You can do this using your computer's disk management tools.

2. **USB-to-SATA adapter**: Since your SSD has a SATA connection, you will need a USB-to-SATA adapter to connect it to the USB port on your Virgin Media router. You can find these adapters online or at electronics stores.

3. **Connect the SSD to the router**: Plug the SATA end of the adapter into your SSD, and the USB end into one of the available USB ports on your Virgin Media router.

4. **Enable file sharing on your router**: Log in to your router's web interface by typing its IP address into your browser's address bar (usually 192.168.0.1 for Virgin Media routers). Enter your admin username and password. This information is often printed on the router itself or can be found in your router's documentation.

5. **Configure USB storage settings**: Look for settings related to USB storage, file sharing, or media sharing in your router's web interface. These settings may vary depending on your specific router model. Enable file sharing, and set up any required sharing preferences or permissions.

6. **Access the shared storage**: From your computer or other devices on the network, access the shared SSD storage by navigating to the router's network storage address, which should be visible as a network location or drive. You can also map this location as a network drive on your computer for easier access.

Keep in mind that while this approach can create a basic shared storage solution, it may not provide all the features and performance of a dedicated NAS device. For a more robust NAS experience, you might want to consider purchasing a dedicated NAS device or building your own NAS with more advanced hardware and software.
