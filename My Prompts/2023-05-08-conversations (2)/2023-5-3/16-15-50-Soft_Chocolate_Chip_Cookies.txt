>> USER: I would like to make some soft chocolate chip cookies (similar to Millie's cookies in the UK) please.

I would like to make 16 cookies and use 200g of butter in the recipe?

Could the recipe please use UK measurements (i.e. no 'cups')? Thanks.

>> ASSISTANT: Of course! Here's a recipe for 16 soft chocolate chip cookies using UK measurements:

Ingredients:
- 200g unsalted butter, softened
- 150g granulated sugar
- 160g light brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 325g plain flour
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 200g chocolate chips (use milk, dark or a combination, as per your preference)

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan-forced, 350°F, gas mark 4). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar using a wooden spoon or an electric mixer until well combined and creamy.

3. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix well until fully combined.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the plain flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.

6. Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

7. Divide the dough into 16 equal portions, each about the size of a golf ball. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 5 cm (2 inches) of space between each dough ball to allow for spreading during baking.

8. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden and the centres are still soft. For softer cookies, lean towards the lower end of the baking time.

9. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your soft chocolate chip cookies!

>> USER: We have melted butter, is it possible to amend the recipe to take this into account please? We don't have baking powder or bicarbonate of soda, does this matter and are there any alternatives or recipes without this please to make soft chocolate chip cookies?

>> ASSISTANT: Certainly! You can still make soft chocolate chip cookies using melted butter and without baking powder or bicarbonate of soda. Here's an amended recipe for you:

Ingredients:
- 200g unsalted butter, melted
- 150g granulated sugar
- 160g light brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 375g plain flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 200g chocolate chips (use milk, dark or a combination, as per your preference)

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan-forced, 350°F, gas mark 4). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, mix together the melted butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar using a wooden spoon or an electric mixer until well combined.

3. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix well until fully combined.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the plain flour and salt.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.

6. Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

7. Chill the dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to help firm it up, as melted butter can make the dough more spreadable.

8. Divide the dough into 16 equal portions, each about the size of a golf ball. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 5 cm (2 inches) of space between each dough ball to allow for spreading during baking.

9. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden and the centres are still soft. For softer cookies, lean towards the lower end of the baking time.

10. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Please note that without baking powder or bicarbonate of soda, your cookies won't rise as much and may be denser, but they should still be soft and delicious. Enjoy your soft chocolate chip cookies!
