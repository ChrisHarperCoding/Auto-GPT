>> USER: What do you think the next 'big thing' will be after 'battle passes' in video games?

>> ASSISTANT: While predicting the exact 'next big thing' in video games is challenging, I can offer some possible trends that might emerge or gain prominence after the battle pass model. Some of these potential trends include:

1. Play-to-earn and blockchain integration: As cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology continue to gain traction, we might see more video games integrating these concepts to offer play-to-earn mechanics. Players could potentially earn in-game currency or items that have real-world value and can be traded or sold.

2. Virtual and augmented reality: With advancements in VR and AR technology, there is potential for more immersive and interactive gaming experiences. As these technologies become more accessible and affordable, we may see a shift towards more VR and AR-based games and experiences.

3. Cloud gaming and game streaming: Cloud gaming platforms and game streaming services could become increasingly popular, allowing players to access high-quality games without needing expensive hardware. This could lead to a subscription-based model for accessing a wide range of games, instead of purchasing individual games or battle passes.

4. Cross-platform and cross-play: As the gaming industry becomes more interconnected, we might see an increased emphasis on cross-platform and cross-play compatibility. This would enable players on different platforms to play together, potentially leading to new revenue models or systems that enhance player engagement across platforms.

5. Personalized AI-driven content: As AI technology advances, we could see more games incorporating personalized experiences based on individual player preferences and behavior. This might lead to new monetization models, such as dynamic in-game purchases that adapt to a player's playstyle, preferences, and progress.

6. Live-service games and continuous content updates: Developers might continue to focus on live-service games with regular content updates and expansions to keep players engaged. This could lead to new models for monetizing content and retaining players over a more extended period.

Ultimately, the next 'big thing' in video games will likely be a combination of various trends and technologies that come together to create new and innovative gaming experiences.
