>> USER: Hi, are you aware of the application called ‘Symphony’ from IRESS please?

>> ASSISTANT: Yes, I am aware of Symphony from IRESS. It is a financial communication and collaboration platform that enables secure messaging, file sharing, and workflow management for financial institutions and their clients. It is designed to help users to streamline their communications and improve efficiency, while maintaining compliance with industry regulations. It is used by many banks, asset managers, and other financial institutions worldwide.


>> USER: Can you use SolarWinds to create a dashboard to monitor each important section of Symphony?

>> ASSISTANT: Yes, it is possible to use SolarWinds to create a dashboard to monitor various aspects of Symphony. SolarWinds is a network and systems management software that provides monitoring and analytics capabilities for various IT infrastructure components, including servers, networks, and applications.

To create a dashboard to monitor Symphony, you would first need to set up SolarWinds to monitor the necessary components of your Symphony environment, such as the servers and databases that it runs on. You would then use SolarWinds' dashboarding capabilities to create visualizations of the data collected from these components, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application performance metrics.

By creating a dashboard, you can quickly and easily identify any performance issues or bottlenecks in your Symphony environment, and take the appropriate actions to resolve them. It can be a powerful tool to help you ensure that your Symphony environment is running smoothly and efficiently, and that your clients are receiving the best possible service.

However, please note that I am not aware of any specific SolarWinds integration or pack with Symphony and this would depend on how Symphony's infrastructure and services are exposed to monitoring and if they can be integrated with SolarWinds.


>> USER: Do you have some example instructions on how to best integrate Symphony into SolarWinds to quickly identify problems. For example, a lost host?

>> ASSISTANT: I'm sorry, I don't have specific example instructions for integrating Symphony into SolarWinds to quickly identify problems, such as a lost host. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the steps that you would need to take to set up SolarWinds to monitor your Symphony environment:

1. First, you would need to ensure that your SolarWinds environment is properly configured to monitor your network and servers. This would include setting up SNMP, WMI, or other monitoring protocols on your servers and devices, as well as configuring SolarWinds to collect data from these devices.

2. Next, you would need to set up monitoring for the specific components of your Symphony environment, such as the servers, databases, and applications that it runs on. This would typically involve configuring SolarWinds to collect data on CPU, memory, and disk usage, as well as network traffic and application performance metrics.

3. Once you have data being collected by SolarWinds, you can create dashboards and alerts to quickly identify any issues or problems with your Symphony environment. For example, you can set up alerts to notify you if CPU or memory usage on a server exceeds a certain threshold, or if network traffic to a specific application is high.

4. Additionally, you would need to configure SolarWinds to monitor any specific Symphony services, such as the messaging service, file sharing service and so on.

5. Finally, you will need to create a custom dashboard that provide a consolidated view of all the Symphony components that you are monitoring, including CPU, memory, and disk usage, network traffic, and application performance metrics, this will help you quickly identify any problem areas.

Please note that the specific steps and configurations required for integrating Symphony into SolarWinds would depend on your specific environment and the version of Symphony you are using. It may require some work with the Symphony's IT and SolarWinds experts to properly integrate the two systems.


>> USER: Can you monitor the application itself using SolarWinds and not just the CPU, memory, HDD stats etc? Thanks

>> ASSISTANT: Yes, it is possible to monitor the application itself using SolarWinds, in addition to monitoring the underlying server and network resources. SolarWinds provides several options for monitoring applications, including:

1. Application Performance Management (APM) - This feature allows you to monitor the performance of specific applications, such as response time, error rates, and throughput. It can also be used to identify and diagnose performance issues within the application.

2. Synthetic Transactions - These are simulated user interactions with the application that can be used to test and monitor the availability and performance of the application from various locations.

3. Custom Pollers - With the use of SNMP, JMX or other protocols, you can create custom pollers to collect data from the Symphony application and monitor specific performance metrics, such as number of active users, number of messages sent, file transfers, and so on.

4. Log Analytics - SolarWinds provides a log analytics and management feature which can be used to collect, parse and analyze the logs generated by Symphony, this can give more insights into how the application is performing.

You will need to configure SolarWinds to monitor the specific aspects of the Symphony application that are important to you and your organization, and then create dashboards and alerts to quickly identify any issues or problems.

Please note that the specific steps and configurations required for monitoring the Symphony application using SolarWinds would depend on the version of Symphony you are using and how the application is built, it may require some work with the Symphony's IT and SolarWinds experts to properly monitor the application.
