very pleased to see you although I know that has no effect no effect on you whatsoever I'm glad you're here I would like it if you would clean thy vaults as graciously as you can impart your wisdom alongside Les's wisdom and then at the same time maybe maybe you might download Destiny 2 for line five I will I won't lie to you though bomb bad Bungie Bungie got rid of everyone who made Maps but then they hired a bunch of writers and if only the writers could also make maps too I mean we would we would be killing this we want to walk bomba through the good that's coming in like fall across I've got a whole list hold up hold on hold on let me just see if any of these tickle you fancy people will be suffering more starting in life fall in-game Loadout presets the removing element or affinity subclasses and their verbs will be able to counter Champions Guardian ranks We're getting a new subclass they're making the game substantially harder especially for lower level players okay okay now this one may get you bombing and I'll buy you as many McChickens as you may want throughout throughout the week that we're playing okay okay we're putting the pressure on them let's let them think about it for a bit first first let's let it let's clean this Vault wow I don't have the sweet business Catalyst done it's garbage all right there this is my tiger spine it's extremely deadly overflow frenzy it's absolutely meta um um I keep the Overflow frenzy for PVE yeah yeah you never know the kinetic buff coming next season too so I'm gonna keep that one night watch I'd keep that rapid explosives very good it is isn't it right cold front there's better kinetic weapons for SMGs personally I think let me see the other role that you have perpetuation which one which one do you think would you use more because they're both almost the exact same role one has more range though one does have more range at 16. once enough Motion One why it's but do I want the Rampage subsistence role just use huckleberry yeah but it's an exotic what other 750s do we have I'm saying kinetics are getting above would you will you ever use cold front is the thing like I might the subsistence Rampage roll I might for real wait is that an extraordinary Edition on the bottom right can I see that one okay yeah yeah keep that delete cold front yeah that one's way better yeah y'all gets you're getting a lot of sharks which you which you desperately need so so get rid of this roll too I would keep that because I think it's your only role and it's my only legendary 750 I think I got right for the kinetic song no extra rendition is it something I I don't I don't have a good PVP Row for Extraordinary rendition okay I would keep that cold front just because it's a PVP role I'm about to transfer okay so we're gonna we're gonna do this I'm gonna I'm gonna transfer everything from my inventory once we deleted enough into the Vault all right this is my this is a snapshot ISO uh roll moving Target I I this is a firmly planted roll I'm gonna be honest with you though guys I don't Crouch enough I know firmly planning is good I just don't Crouch enough once I'm moving too much should I get rid of it no one I would get rid of the firm to find one if you don't Crouch I just don't cry yeah Snapchat what you target which is better um I've got verbal field prep now here's the thing I already have a succession I already have exactly so should I just go and kill this don't just delete that yeah succession is better everywhere man dude I had this for so long so long all right Surplus opening shot assault this is honestly my best role but at the same time I haven't used it in so long okay it is coming back next season for trials here's my two rolls opening threat detector opening Surplus a song don't need both so just choose which one you would probably use until the new one comes out you know what I'm saying I feel like this is from reversed out because I have I have full choke I have assaults you know what I mean I have a variety of different options here goodbye Surplus roll you have a lot of shotguns especially now aggressives aren't the best so yeah oh that's a pretty good Dyer pretty solid one man I feel like you just have to keep it because of like how much you've used it before you know what I mean yeah you have four true prophecies we're deleting at least three of them oh no dude dude I the 120 meta rode around and I was so happy I had these rolls wait can 120 is even two tablet Rampage nope you need harmony damn all right so get rid of this one mama what do you think uh yes goodbye Drew all right but look at this one hold on I don't I don't use it I haven't used it but gotta admit kinda nuts I think I personally think opening Shauna primary is completely useless opening shot on a primary I think it's used less is right it's useless I love openings those are the facts oh my God you can have your opinion at the end of the day but you opening for specials is fine it gets really good obviously because it's one shot kills but like opening our primary you can get Rangefinder in that slot okay okay all right so you want me to kill this role I'll leave it to you because because you seem to like opening shot on primaries but I'ma be honest I'm probably not gonna use that over your eyes I'm going to be I'm gonna be straight I have never used this hand Cannon once I've had it in my voice I've had it in my Vault for years but now that I know I'm about to have to delete it I'm scared I'm scared I'm missing out all right it's not even Masterwork I just true it's not your Masterwork all right look at this one though I gotta keep this one right look at that what do you think about that over overflow Rampage 12 pages of this [Laughter] do you think you'd use a 120 handgun in any situation of the game over like an SMG or an auto rifle or Scout oh my God look at this friction exists look at this nasty though yeah I'll be honest that's kind of cheeks why build prep bro you need me on a primary are we serious here no way you're serious here you need that extra ammo man yeah [Laughter] yet which I'm gonna do um nameless Midnight's coming next season so what do you think you think you'll use nameless midnight over this I'm gonna be straight I don't use 150s ever in PVE then goodbye world all right this Steady Hand through prophecy exists get that out of here this Steady Hand but no no no this Steady Hand does feel quite nice for different reasons I use them for different reasons like if I'm going for like range and staying on the outskirts I I go  it okay I kept this one because it was a max range role and it was an in-depth but um keep that and delete the other one what do you think you got two of them so I personally think this is better I I think that one is better detector yes auto loading is just kind of a waste here it is yeah it's got it just got sexy range but of course it runs into the cab too yes all right listen I would keep that if I want that roll I want that roll song head Seeker got above high Albedo has actually been been cracking out for me yeah I'd keep that you're so classy imagine Rock and strand using Strand and proc and osmosis what's your other fatebreaker that you have there that's how you had two uh explosives kill this is my PVP role and then I've got this row I'm just a classic a classic a classic yes just always worth keeping so two of those that one has rewind rounds I think is underrated as hell I don't really like exposed to payload with firefly because it's supposed to damage yeah it kind of It kind of works against it they had anything but osmosis in demo that's fine serve in later I've used this so much let's be real you will never use that good in your life damn it Chad I meant to review it I wanted to review it all right skate lock Oh I thought she had a bad role what's the other one oh that one's a guy I think that was a goner Shepherds what I don't I wanted to make it metal I would never use a sniper I kept all of my shepherd's watch because for some reason it's nuts no yes and look we can even raise the mag size oh no no you can to opening shot roll all right we've done nothing to your Vault but this is my only Riptide you don't have a chill clip rule no man I had I had a lot I had a lot and I don't know what I did with them I guess I deleted them of all the things before reset or before Monday yeah what if rapid fire Fusion rifles got a buff in PvP I'm keeping I gotta keep it I feel like you get a better role eventually by the time maybe I'll I'll try getting another roll goodbye if I get some yeah goodbye oh my hockey uh well goodbye for us come take the wheel it's just there's too many rules I know I know I know guys

heating up on the bowl yeah I think I think cool guy made a video about a thousand yards there with heating up yeah you need a kill and you only get two bullets trash this is my Matador my only Matador yeah and I actually think about 31 yeah it's good I go corkscrewing that what do you have what do you have wait no never mind never mind you're good just kidding this is you're never using that in your life wait you have a crafted one I do have a crafted one I don't and you can't I get rid of that one that one's bad for sure that I get rid of that one the second to last one I'd probably get rid of it that one I wouldn't use that one I would never use that one okay I would get rid of the non-a-depth one because like it has Perpetual kill clip of the rest of it's just not very good right fast yeah right is bombard alive Bobby there no how much right now probably all right so keep these two or no no I need to decide between one of these probably the second one huh uh 64 versus 67. yeah the stats are keep that for solar um get out of there goodbye threaded you've been so good to me um terrible you can get it in next season if you really care for it so probably a better perks than too this is terrible uh get rid of that one um the other tomorrow's answer is better [Music] rewind rounds I said the first one because of the video on the junkie just for damage bonus if he needed it but um that's not bad bloodkeys you know crowd splitter just for you cross you can keep that thank you thank you so much this is my mode get rid of the second one the zero one was goated two I have another worlds 84 62 16. they're both they're both 62s just keep the master yep all right oh yeah that's pretty awful yeah that one's gone then second one yeah that one does have higher res and discipline I think that's your best one honestly it's higher base stat and it's got a point where it counts that's a that's a 62 total all right two astrocides I guess I'll keep this the 66 stat roll yeah yeah that's a 59 total that's pretty low I'd keep that yeah not good no um that's another pretty nice distribution again I keep both of those okay that's bad that's bad yeah Beach uh you have two lucky raspberries that's a 60 keep the 68 it's got more discipline it's a grenade exotic um no oh that's fine that's a garden piece that was ancient I got two house fires harder they must light if it's in the vault it means you've never used that part of it most light 65 which one is what go with the keep the lower Mobility one yeah this one's only stopping it is in the vault here and I've got like four stars is this 66 piece okay so cloak if any are not artifice or not from a specific raid delete them all yeah any that don't mean no nothing so uh wait or the only other one would be uh iron Banner because of needing to get full rep because remember if you if you have an iron Banner piece you can then put another ornament on top of it to count as two pieces so I would keep my B pieces yeah so keep this I'd keep IB just because you can uh you"

>> ASSISTANT: Title: (32) Bombad Returns (And Deletes Half My Vault) | Destiny 2 Lightfall Prep - YouTube

In this YouTube video, the creator and their friends discuss cleaning out their Destiny 2 vault and preparing for the Lightfall expansion. They review and evaluate the various weapons and armor pieces in their collection, considering factors like stats, perks, and potential future buffs. They also share their thoughts on different weapons and armor pieces, as well as the possible changes coming in Lightfall, such as the removal of elemental affinity subclasses, introduction of in-game loadout presets, and increased difficulty for lower-level players. Throughout the video, they reminisce about previous experiences with the game and consider whether to keep or delete certain items based on their usefulness and sentimental value.

>> USER: Thank you that summary is great. Would it be possible to create a Chrome extensions that would analyse a user's Destiny 2 vault, apply the same logic to their current vault as was applied in the video, and then give a nicely formatted summary of the items that the user can safely delete and the reasons why? Thanks.

>> ASSISTANT: Yes, it is possible to create a Chrome extension that would analyze a user's Destiny 2 vault, apply similar logic as in the video, and provide a summary of items to delete with reasons. Here's a high-level overview of how you could approach building this extension:

1. Access the Destiny 2 API: First, you'll need to access Bungie's Destiny 2 API to retrieve the user's vault data. Register an application on Bungie's developer portal (https://www.bungie.net/en/Application) and obtain an API key to authenticate your requests.

2. Analyze the vault data: Once you have access to the user's vault data, write logic to analyze the items based on the criteria used in the video. You can create a set of rules or a scoring system that determines which items are safe to delete. The rules should consider factors like item rarity, weapon type, perks, and user preferences.

3. Create a user interface: Design a user interface for the extension that displays the analyzed items, along with reasons for deleting them. This interface should be user-friendly and allow users to easily review and confirm the suggested items for deletion

>> USER: Thank you that's fantastic. Could you please help me to create a fantastic free website that would explain my idea for this application in an appealing manner? This is because Bungie require a website as part of the API application. Thanks.
