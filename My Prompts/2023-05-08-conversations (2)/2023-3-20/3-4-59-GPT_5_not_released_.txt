>> USER: GPT-5?

>> ASSISTANT: As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, GPT-5 had not been released. I am a language model based on GPT-4 architecture. Since my knowledge is not up-to-date, I cannot provide information on any developments that might have occurred after September 2021. If GPT-5 has been released, you may want to research the latest information available from OpenAI or other sources.
