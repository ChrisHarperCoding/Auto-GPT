>> USER: Hi, I have been prescribed medical cannabis in the UK. I am trying this in oil form as I don't smoke or vape. The prescription is as follows:

Adven Indica 20mg per ml:
THC - 10mg/ml
CBD - 10mg/ml
Take 0.2 to 1ml sublingually

However, I don't think it's having much effect, I've written some rough notes. Would you be able to organise them please so that I can show the doctor, thanks:

0.2ml under tongue at 22.30pm

This tastes and smells quite strong
Probably need to check whether other people can smell it
Wasn't too bad putting 0.2ml under tongue

Very tired as been back and forth to London for work over last two weeks

Just a quick test but I feel calm, level headed, ready for sleep at 23.10

8am I'm on early shift so will take at 9am

9am 0.2ml under tongue

10.30 not sure if it's taken any effect yet

12.00 not sure 0.2ml of this is very effective, felt mild improvement but not compared to usual

12.30 0.3ml under tongue

This will be unaffordable because at this rate, it feels as though it will require several ml's a day

9pm 1ml under tongue
At best at this dose, if this works 1ml x times per day
44 pounds for 10ml
4.40 a day minimum
132 a month plus?

1ml is kinda gross to take as well

2PM 1ml in drink, because I would like to see if consumption vs under tongue has any benefits and this would be preferable to under tongue.

4PM feel a little bit calmer? 


5PM, doesn't feel as though this has been effective.
