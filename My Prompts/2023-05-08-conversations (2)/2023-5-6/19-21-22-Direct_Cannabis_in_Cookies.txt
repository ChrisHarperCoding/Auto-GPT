>> USER: I 'decarb' cannabis at 120 degrees Celsius for 25 minutes after grinding. I then infuse into butter, oil over 40 minutes in a pan over very low heat. Can I just add the decarbed cannabis into my recipe for cookies rather than melting the butter and infusing then using the melted butter? 

>> ASSISTANT: Yes, you can add decarbed cannabis directly into your cookie recipe instead of infusing it into the butter or oil beforehand. However, there are a few things to consider if you choose to go this route:

1. Even distribution: When you infuse cannabis into butter or oil, you're ensuring a more even distribution of the cannabinoids throughout the finished product. Adding the decarbed cannabis directly to the cookie dough might result in some cookies having more cannabis than others. Be sure to mix the cannabis thoroughly into your dough to minimize this issue.

2. Texture: Since you're adding ground cannabis directly to the dough, the texture of your cookies might be a bit gritty or have a stronger plant-like taste. Infusing the cannabis into the butter helps to minimize these textural and flavor differences.

3. Potency: Infusing cannabis into butter or oil allows for better extraction of the cannabinoids, ensuring a more potent end product. Adding the decarbed cannabis directly to the dough might result in a less potent product as some cannabinoids might not be fully released into the cookies.

If you're okay with these trade-offs, you can certainly try adding the decarbed cannabis directly to your cookie recipe. Just remember to decarb your cannabis properly and mix it thoroughly into the dough for the most even distribution possible.
