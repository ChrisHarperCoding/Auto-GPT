Here's a recipe for 16 soft chocolate chip cookies using UK measurements:\n\nIngredients:\n- 200g unsalted butter, softened\n- 150g granulated sugar\n- 160g light brown sugar\n- 1 large egg\n- 1 large egg yolk\n- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n- 325g plain flour\n- 1/2 tsp baking powder\n- 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda\n- 1/2 tsp salt\n- 200g chocolate chips (use milk, dark or a combination, as per your preference)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan-forced, 350°F, gas mark 4). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\n2. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar using a wooden spoon or an electric mixer until well combined and creamy.\n\n3. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix well until fully combined.\n\n4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the plain flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt.\n\n5. Gradually add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
