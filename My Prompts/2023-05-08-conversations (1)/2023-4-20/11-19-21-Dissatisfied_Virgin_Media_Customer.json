I've seen others get discounts and service upgrades. Can you help me to format my following draft notes into the best possible letter to get the best outcome please? Here are the notes:\n\nHi, I have to admit I'm getting very frustrated at the number of dropouts with my broadband connection. I report these as often as I can, I do this using my other 5g Internet connection, that I have never had a problem with. \n\nIn addition, I've recently had another letter saying my prices are going up yet again. \n\nWhat profit does virgin media make? Can a large national corporation that is probably doing just fine not absorb some of the short term inflation related costs until things calm down? Otherwise you're irritating your entire customer base and they will either look elsewhere or be advised to do so by friends / family. \n\nI'm very happy with my 3 5g SIM, i get better speeds and service than my wired virgin media connection. \n\nI've recently helped one of my friends to switch to a 5g router as they were also unhappy with their Internet service. Can you please let me know why on earth I shouldn't just do the same and get better service at a much lower cost?\n\nI've also shared a lengthy conversation I had with vm retentions last time my bill was due to go up and to be honest, wouldn't it have been easier to offer me a good service at a reasonable price, I would therefore have no reason to be unhappy with my service. I know for a fact I'm going to have to go through the same retentions rigmarole this year again and it seems a waste of everyone's time.\n\nCan you match or preferably beat 3's offer?

As a loyal customer, I expect a certain level of service and value for my money. Unfortunately, I feel that Virgin Media has not been meeting these expectations.\n\nMy broadband connection has been experiencing frequent dropouts, which I have reported as often as I can. To do this, I have to rely on my separate 5G internet connection, which has consistently provided a stable and reliable service. It is disheartening to see that my wired connection with Virgin Media is not performing at the same level as my 5G service.\n\nAdditionally, I recently received a letter informing me of yet another price increase for my broadband service. I understand that the economy is facing challenges due to inflation, but I believe that a large national corporation like Virgin Media should be able to absorb some of these costs temporarily to avoid further aggravating its customer base. As a result of these continuous price hikes, customers like me may consider exploring other options, potentially leading to a loss of business for your company.\n\nIn fact, I have already helped a friend switch to a 5G router due to their dissatisfaction with their internet service. My experience with my 3 5G SIM has been excellent, with better speeds and service than my Virgin Media connection. I must ask, why should I not simply switch to a 5G router for improved service at a lower cost?\n\nIn the past, I have engaged in lengthy conversations with your retentions department to negotiate a fair price for my service. This process is both time-consuming and frustrating. I believe that if Virgin Media were to offer me a good service at a reasonable price from the outset, there would be no need for such back-and-forths. As it stands, I am anticipating another round of negotiations this year, which seems like a waste of both your company's and my time.\n\nI kindly request that you consider matching or, preferably, beating the offer provided by 3. If you are unable to do so, I may have no choice but to explore other options for my internet service. I truly hope that we can come to a mutually beneficial resolution, as I would prefer to continue my relationship with Virgin Media if my concerns are adequately addressed.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"]},"create_time":1681986033.20502,"end_turn":true,"id":"425835e4-31b8-402e-b73e-7d35d28b9667","metadata":{"finish_details":{"stop":"<|diff_marker|>","type":"stop"},"model_slug":"gpt-4","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"380255e5-9766-482b-a67e-ca949ab2407f"},"91a5aad1-07d5-412c-8e68-e6ecbfcba012":{"children":[],"id":"91a5aad1-07d5-412c-8e68-e6ecbfcba012","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"assistant"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["In this scenario, contacting higher-level executives may be helpful if you've already exhausted the regular customer service channels and haven't achieved a satisfactory outcome. Some key executives at Virgin Media that you could consider contacting are:\n\n1. CEO (Chief Executive Officer) - The CEO is the highest-ranking executive and is ultimately responsible for the company's overall performance.

When doing so, maintain a professional and respectful tone, and provide all the relevant details related to your issue.
