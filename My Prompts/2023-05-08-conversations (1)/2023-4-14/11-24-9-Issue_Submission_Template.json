Here are some reasons why a template is necessary:\n\n1. Saves time: A template ensures that all the necessary information is provided upfront, reducing the back-and-forth between the user and the support team. This saves time for both parties.\n\n2. Provides clarity: A template helps the user to organize their thoughts and provide clear and concise information about the issue they are experiencing. This makes it easier for the support team to understand the problem and provide a solution.\n\n3. Improves communication: A template ensures that all relevant information is communicated, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or miscommunications between the user and the support team.\n\n4. Ensures consistency: A template ensures that all users provide the same information when submitting an issue or service request. This helps the support team to identify patterns and trends, and to develop more efficient and effective solutions.\n\n5. Enhances quality: A template helps to ensure that all necessary information is provided, reducing the risk of incomplete or inaccurate information being submitted. This enhances the quality of the support provided by the team.\n\nOverall, a template is a valuable tool for improving communication, reducing time wastage, and enhancing the quality of support provided. It is a simple but effective way to ensure that all necessary information is provided upfront, saving time and improving the efficiency of the support process."]},"create_time":1681468020.552777,"end_turn":true,"id":"297ee2d4-0689-4165-a10f-13c9dffd8035","metadata":{"finish_details":{"stop":"<|im_end|>","type":"stop"},"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"fe7bb867-f27c-4a4d-af29-747efaa406d9"},"31c946f2-9d81-4e41-bc24-a9fb3f7355a8":{"children":["a26aeaf3-9ff7-4c9a-8295-0234e8c09d6a"],"id":"31c946f2-9d81-4e41-bc24-a9fb3f7355a8"},"6046fc10-8dcd-4590-8b4d-6833300f9ab3":{"children":["fe7bb867-f27c-4a4d-af29-747efaa406d9"],"id":"6046fc10-8dcd-4590-8b4d-6833300f9ab3","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"assistant"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Sure, here's an example template you can use:\n\n**Subject:** [Brief summary of the issue]\n\n**Description:**\n\n[Please provide a detailed description of the issue you are experiencing, including any error messages or steps to reproduce the issue]\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\n[What were you expecting to happen?]\n\n**Actual Outcome:**\n\n[What actually happened?]\n\n**Environment:**\n\n[Please provide information about your environment such as operating system, browser, device, etc.]\n\n**Attachments:**\n\n[If applicable, please attach any relevant screenshots or files]\n\n**Priority:**\n\n[Low/Medium/High/Urgent]\n\n**Impact:**\n\n[What is the impact of this issue on your work or the business?]\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n[Is there any additional information that you think would be helpful for us to know?]\n\nI hope this helps!"]},"create_time":1681467851.665321,"end_turn":true,"id":"6046fc10-8dcd-4590-8b4d-6833300f9ab3","metadata":{"finish_details":{"stop":"<|im_end|>","type":"stop"},"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"1bbd24f4-6004-447f-89fd-22bb8088c2c1"},"a26aeaf3-9ff7-4c9a-8295-0234e8c09d6a":{"children":["1bbd24f4-6004-447f-89fd-22bb8088c2c1"],"id":"a26aeaf3-9ff7-4c9a-8295-0234e8c09d6a","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"system"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"create_time":1681467849.674506,"end_turn":true,"id":"a26aeaf3-9ff7-4c9a-8295-0234e8c09d6a","metadata":{},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"31c946f2-9d81-4e41-bc24-a9fb3f7355a8"},"fe7bb867-f27c-4a4d-af29-747efaa406d9":{"children":["297ee2d4-0689-4165-a10f-13c9dffd8035"],"id":"fe7bb867-f27c-4a4d-af29-747efaa406d9","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"user"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Thank you, \n\nUsers insist that they don't have time to fill in such a template but then more time is wasted anyway trying to get the info out of them so that we can do our job. \n\nWe have to fill in such a form when requesting support and it would be very beneficial to us.
