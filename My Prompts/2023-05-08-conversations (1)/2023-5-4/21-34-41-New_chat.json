However, I can provide you with a high-level design plan and some code snippets to help you get started on creating a Destiny 2 character progress tracking application.\n\nGiven the requirement for automatic tracking, the application should be built using the Bungie.net API to access Destiny 2 game data. You can find documentation and instructions for setting up an API key at: https://bungie-net.github.io/\n\nHere's a high-level plan for the application:\n\n1. Register and set up an API key with Bungie.net.\n2. Create a frontend with a visually appealing, modern design, and responsive layout.\n3. Implement the backend server, handling requests from the frontend and fetching data from the Bungie.net API.\n4. Store data in a local database for caching and faster response times.\n5. Implement a user authentication system to securely store user-specific data.\n6. Test the application for reliability, performance, and accessibility.\n\nHere is an example of how you could start fetching data for a given player's characters:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nAPI_KEY = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\nGAMERTAG = \"IncensedCape\"\n\ndef get_player_id():\n    headers = {\"X-API-Key\": API_KEY}\n    response = requests.get(\n        f\"https://www.bungie.net/Platform/Destiny2/SearchDestinyPlayer/1/{GAMERTAG}/\",\n        headers=headers,\n    )\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        player_id = response.json()[\"Response\"][0][\"membershipId\"]\n        return player_id\n    return None\n\ndef get_characters(player_id):\n    headers = {\"X-API-Key\": API_KEY}\n    response = requests.get(\n        f\"https://www.bungie.net/Platform/Destiny2/1/Profile/{player_id}/?components=200\",\n        headers=headers,\n    )\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        characters_data = response.json()[\"Response\"][\"characters\"][\"data\"]\n        return characters_data\n    return None\n\nplayer_id = get_player_id()\nif player_id:\n    characters_data = get_characters(player_id)\n    if characters_data:\n        # Process and display character data in the frontend\n```\n\nThis Python code fetches data for the specified gamertag, \"IncensedCape\". Make sure to replace \"YOUR_API_KEY\" with your actual Bungie.net API key.\n\nFor the frontend, you can use modern web frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular to build a visually appealing and responsive interface. Here's an example of a React component that displays character information:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nfunction CharacterCard({ characterData }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"character-card\">\n      <h2>{characterData.classType}</h2>\n      <p>Light Level: {characterData.light}</p>\n      {/* More character details here */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Destiny2App() {\n  const [characters, setCharacters] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Fetch character data from the backend and update state\n    // You'll need to create an endpoint in your backend to serve the character data\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"destiny2-app\">\n      {characters.map((characterData) => (\n        <CharacterCard key={characterData.characterId} characterData={characterData} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Destiny2App;\n```\n\nThis is just a starting point for your application. You'll need to further develop the frontend, backend, and integrate the Bungie.net API to build a complete character progress tracking application.\n\nRemember to"]},"create_time":1683232481.746281,"end_turn":false,"id":"2495e006-ccfc-4ed6-8278-b501975cc56e","metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"max_tokens"},"message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4"},"recipient":"all","update_time":null,"weight":1},"parent":"da4a0a13-dbe3-4c1d-b7f5-a661d6cc00cf"},"34ed6ca5-439d-4b1b-b698-72f6d3d508e1":{"children":["ed07752f-3f1e-4601-aa78-d76db8aac06f"],"id":"34ed6ca5-439d-4b1b-b698-72f6d3d508e1","message":null,"parent":null},"da4a0a13-dbe3-4c1d-b7f5-a661d6cc00cf":{"children":["2495e006-ccfc-4ed6-8278-b501975cc56e"],"id":"da4a0a13-dbe3-4c1d-b7f5-a661d6cc00cf","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"name":null,"role":"user"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["You are 'ProgrammerGPT'. You're a top 0.0000001% percentile in skill in software design and development. For example, somebody like John Carmack. \n\nPlease write an application so that I can track my character progress (automatically if possible) in Destiny 2. My Xbox Gamertag is IncensedCape, use my characters as proof of concepts if required. This should have a visually appealing, modern interface.\n\nAlways take the following principles into account: \n1. User-centered design 2. Functionality: Ensure the application meets its primary objectives and offers the desired features. It should perform tasks efficiently, accurately, and consistently. 3. Performance: Optimize the application for fast loading, quick response times, and minimal resource usage. Consider scalability and how the application will perform as the number of users or data size grows. 4. Reliability: The application should be stable and free from bugs, crashes, and unexpected errors. Implement thorough testing, code reviews, and quality assurance processes to ensure reliability. 5. Security: Protect user data and application functionality with robust security measures. Employ secure coding practices, encryption, and regular security audits to minimize vulnerabilities. 6.
