However, I can provide you with a simple example using Python and the Flask framework to get started. This example will cover basic event creation and display.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Python and Flask installed. If you don't have Flask, you can install it using pip:\n\n```\npip install Flask\n```\n\nNow, let's create a simple Flask application. Create a new folder for your project, and inside that folder, create a file named `app.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for\nimport sqlite3\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ndef init_db():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('events.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events\n                 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, title TEXT, date TEXT, time TEXT, location TEXT, description TEXT)''')\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('events.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('SELECT * FROM events')\n    events = c.fetchall()\n    conn.close()\n    return render_template('index.html', events=events)\n\n@app.route('/add_event', methods=['POST'])\ndef add_event():\n    title = request.form['title']\n    date = request.form['date']\n    time = request.form['time']\n    location = request.form['location']\n    description = request.form['description']\n\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('events.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('INSERT INTO events (title, date, time, location, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)', (title, date, time, location, description))\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\n    return redirect(url_for('index'))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    init_db()\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nNow, create a `templates` folder in your project folder and inside it, create a file named `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Event Calendar</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Event Calendar</h1>\n    <form action=\"{{ url_for('add_event') }}\" method=\"post\">\n        <label for=\"title\">Title:</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"title\" name=\"title\" required>\n        <br>\n        <label for=\"date\">Date:</label>\n        <input type=\"date\" id=\"date\" name=\"date\" required>\n        <br>\n        <label for=\"time\">Time:</label>\n        <input type=\"time\" id=\"time\" name=\"time\" required>\n        <br>\n        <label for=\"location\">Location:</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"location\" name=\"location\">\n        <br>\n        <label for=\"description\">Description:</label>\n        <textarea id=\"description\" name=\"description\"></textarea>\n        <br>\n        <button type=\"submit\">Add Event</button>\n    </form>\n\n    <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>\n    <ul>\n        {% for event in events %}\n        <li>{{ event[1] }} - {{ event[2] }} - {{ event[3] }} - {{ event[4] }} - {{ event[5] }}</li>\n        {% endfor %}\n    </ul>\n</body>\n</html>\n"]},"create_time":1683172744.316112,"end_turn":false,"id":"4f4219a9-5c50-4516-b5c2-1d7fe994fe9f","metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"max_tokens"},"message_type":"next","model_slug":"gpt-4"},"recipient":"all","update_time":null,"weight":1},"parent":"398b94d7-5ed5-4141-816a-0abfb04ae922"},"687c0cc8-e97e-4e04-9a2e-e7d52df81169":{"children":["398b94d7-5ed5-4141-816a-0abfb04ae922"],"id":"687c0cc8-e97e-4e04-9a2e-e7d52df81169","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"name":null,"role":"assistant"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["To develop an application with the main features and functionalities mentioned, you should follow the steps below:\n\n1. Plan and research:\n   a. Identify your target audience and their needs.\n   b. Study the competition and learn from their strengths and weaknesses.\n   c. List the desired features and prioritize them based on importance and feasibility.\n\n2. Create wireframes and mockups:\n   a. Design a layout for the main screens and navigation.\n   b.
