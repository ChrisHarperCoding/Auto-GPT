Please note that the exact steps may vary depending on the SolarWinds version and modules you have installed.\n\n1. **Set up Server & Application Monitor (SAM) component monitors:**\n   First, you'll need to create custom component monitors in SAM to monitor the Document Archiver application. This may include monitoring services, processes, log files, and custom scripts to gather data about the Document Archiver's performance.\n\n   a. Go to the \"All Applications\" page in the SAM module.\n   \n   b. Click on \"Create New Template\" and provide a name and description for your custom template, such as \"Document Archiver Monitoring.\"\n\n   c. Add component monitors to the template. You might use pre-built monitors like \"Windows Service Monitor\" to check the status of the Document Archiver service, or \"Process Monitor\" to monitor resource utilization. For more specific monitoring requirements, you may need to create custom script monitors to collect data from the Document Archiver directly.\n\n   d. Assign the template to the appropriate server(s) where the Document Archiver is installed.\n\n2. **Configure alerts and notifications:**\n   Next, you'll want to set up custom alerts and notifications based on the data collected from the component monitors. This will help you stay informed about any issues or performance degradation in the Document Archiver.\n\n   a. Navigate to the \"Alerts & Activity\" section in the SolarWinds Orion web console.\n\n   b. Click on \"Manage Alerts\" and then \"Add New Alert.\"\n\n   c. Define the alert properties, such as name, description, severity, and trigger conditions based on the component monitors you've set up for the Document Archiver.\n\n   d. Configure the alert actions, such as sending an email to the Application Support team or updating the status in the dashboard.\n\n3. **Create a custom dashboard:**\n   Now that you've set up the component monitors and alerts, it's time to create a custom dashboard to display the data.\n\n   a. Go to the \"Home\" section in the SolarWinds Orion web console.\n\n   b. Click on \"Customize Page\" and then \"Add New Tab.\" Provide a name for the new tab, such as \"Document Archiver Dashboard.\"\n\n   c. Click on \"Add Widgets\" and search for the appropriate widgets to display the data from your component monitors and alerts. Some widgets you may want to consider include \"Custom Chart,\" \"Custom Table,\" \"Alerts,\" and \"AppStack Environment.\"\n\n   d. Configure each widget to display the data from your component monitors and alerts related to the Document Archiver. You can customize the appearance, data sources, and time frames for each widget.\n\n4. **Configure dashboard refresh settings:**\n   Finally, you'll want to set the dashboard to automatically refresh and update based on the latest data.\n\n   a. Click on \"Settings\" in the top right corner of the SolarWinds Orion web console.\n\n   b. Go to \"All Settings\" and then \"Web Console Settings.\"\n\n   c. Set the \"Auto-Refresh Interval\" to your desired refresh rate, such as every 5 or 10 minutes.\n\nWith these steps, you should have a proof of concept dashboard in SolarWinds that monitors the Document Archiver's performance. You can further customize and refine the dashboard based on your requirements and the data you collect from the component monitors and alerts."]},"create_time":1682605107.326651,"end_turn":true,"id":"debc0b64-2d81-48c8-b2db-45c8510bd0bc","metadata":{"finish_details":{"stop":"<|diff_marker|>","type":"stop"},"model_slug":"gpt-4","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"44996a53-df2c-4e06-adda-59fe608c1675"}},"moderation_results":[],"saveHistory":true,"shouldRefresh":false,"skipped":false,"title":"Dashboard for Document Archiver.","toneCode":"default","update_time":"2023-04-27T14:18:27+00:00","writingStyleCode":"default"}
