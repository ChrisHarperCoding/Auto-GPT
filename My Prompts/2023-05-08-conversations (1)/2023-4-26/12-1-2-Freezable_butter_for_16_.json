Here are some recipe ideas that you can make with melted Lurpak butter and divide into 16 portions to freeze:\n\n1. Garlic and Herb Butter: Melt the Lurpak and mix with garlic and chopped herbs, such as parsley and thyme. Pour the mixture into small silicone ice cube trays and freeze. Once frozen, pop the cubes out and store in a freezer bag. These can be used to top grilled meats or vegetables.\n\n2. Brown Butter Rice Krispie Treats: Melt the Lurpak butter in a large pot and add marshmallows. Once melted, stir in Rice Krispies cereal and pour the mixture into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Let cool, cut into 16 pieces, and freeze.\n\n3. Lemon Butter Cookies: Cream melted Lurpak butter with sugar and lemon zest. Add in flour and baking powder and mix until a dough forms. Roll the dough into balls and flatten slightly. Bake for 12-15 minutes at 350°F. Once cooled, divide into 16 portions and freeze.\n\n4. Mushroom and Butter Sauce: Melt the Lurpak butter in a pan and add sliced mushrooms. Cook until the mushrooms are tender and then stir in flour and beef broth. Simmer until the sauce thickens and then season with salt and pepper. Divide into 16 portions and freeze.\n\n5. Spinach and Feta Stuffed Chicken: Melt the Lurpak butter and mix with spinach, feta cheese, and garlic. Cut a slit in each chicken breast and stuff with the mixture. Bake at 375°F for 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Divide into 16 portions and freeze.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started, but you can use melted Lurpak butter in many different recipes. Just make sure to store the portions in an airtight container or freezer bag to prevent freezer burn."]},"create_time":1682506936.054801,"end_turn":true,"id":"540ea4a2-6cc0-4504-b963-37e09a783abb","metadata":{"finish_details":{"stop":"<|im_end|>","type":"stop"},"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"d4d6c963-a159-4785-879b-935fd1ecd4c0"},"c793895c-560c-4022-877c-5876eb19dc09":{"children":[],"id":"c793895c-560c-4022-877c-5876eb19dc09","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"assistant"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["\n\nSure! If you are looking to melt 20g of Lurpak butter, you can do so by placing it in a heat-resistant bowl and microwaving it in 15-second intervals, stirring in between, until it is fully melted.\n\nOnce the butter is melted, you can use it in any recipe that requires butter. To divide it into 16 portions, you can measure out approximately 1.25g of melted butter and use it as needed.\n\nIf you are looking to freeze the food, it's important to consider what type of food you are making as some foods freeze better than others. However, assuming that you are making a recipe that is suitable for freezing, you can divide it into 16 portions and place each portion in an airtight container or freezer bag. Label each container with the name of the dish and the date it was prepared.\n\nIn general, most frozen foods can be kept in the freezer for up to 3 months. If you want to keep them for longer, you can invest in a vacuum sealer or a chest freezer that can maintain a lower temperature than a regular fridge freezer."]},"create_time":1682506864.556098,"end_turn":true,"id":"c793895c-560c-4022-877c-5876eb19dc09","metadata":{"finish_details":{"stop":"<|im_end|>","type":"stop"},"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"08f9b75b-696b-4650-8f20-354e52e8e2ff"},"d4d6c963-a159-4785-879b-935fd1ecd4c0":{"children":["540ea4a2-6cc0-4504-b963-37e09a783abb"],"id":"d4d6c963-a159-4785-879b-935fd1ecd4c0","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"user"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Hi, I am melting 200g of Lurpak and would then like to put that into some food that I can divide into 16 portions.
