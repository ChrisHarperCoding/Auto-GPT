In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder.\n\n2. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract.\n\n3. Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, whisking gently just until combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough pancakes. A few lumps in the batter are fine.\n\n4. Allow the batter to rest for about 5 minutes. This helps create a fluffier pancake texture.\n\n5. Preheat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly coat the surface with cooking spray or a thin layer of butter.\n\n6. Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, pour the batter onto the heated skillet or griddle. You can cook multiple pancakes at once, but be sure to leave enough space between them to allow for flipping.\n\n7. Cook the pancakes until bubbles form on the surface and the edges begin to look set (about 2-3 minutes). Use a spatula to carefully flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.\n\n8. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and keep them warm by covering them with a clean kitchen towel or placing them in a low-temperature oven (around 200°F/93°C) while you continue cooking the remaining batter.\n\n9. Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or a dusting of powdered sugar.\n\nEnjoy your homemade American-style pancakes!"]},"create_time":1682720287.357544,"end_turn":true,"id":"2ac21850-26c3-4a17-9920-c4dfc35e7e10","metadata":{"finish_details":{"stop":"<|diff_marker|>","type":"stop"},"model_slug":"gpt-4","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"1f73884f-7fe9-4afc-b14a-54307cedc359"},"a07a6696-5a62-4347-9c37-167f1f489ed3":{"children":["c60699cb-22e1-497b-98da-e70dd3fb64e1"],"id":"a07a6696-5a62-4347-9c37-167f1f489ed3"},"c60699cb-22e1-497b-98da-e70dd3fb64e1":{"children":["1f73884f-7fe9-4afc-b14a-54307cedc359"],"id":"c60699cb-22e1-497b-98da-e70dd3fb64e1","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"system"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"create_time":1682720244.942882,"end_turn":true,"id":"c60699cb-22e1-497b-98da-e70dd3fb64e1","metadata":{},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"a07a6696-5a62-4347-9c37-167f1f489ed3"}},"moderation_results":[],"saveHistory":true,"shouldRefresh":false,"skipped":false,"title":"American Pancakes Recipe","toneCode":"default","update_time":"2023-04-28T22:18:07+00:00","writingStyleCode":"default"}
