This will allow you to create a web application that can easily be adapted for mobile platforms in the future.\n\n4. Set up the project structure following best practices. Here's a suggested structure for your application:\n\n```\nfact-find-app/\n├── backend/\n│   ├── src/\n│   ├── test/\n│   ├── package.json\n│   └── .gitignore\n└── frontend/\n    ├── public/\n    ├── src/\n    ├── test/\n    ├── package.json\n    └── .gitignore\n```\n\n5. Add the necessary dependencies for your project. For the backend, you can start with dependencies like `express`, `mongoose`, and `jsonwebtoken`. For the frontend, you'll need `react`, `react-dom`, `axios`, and other libraries that fit your requirements.\n\n6. Implement a basic \"Hello World\" application to ensure your project is set up correctly. For the backend, create a simple Express server that listens on a specific port and returns a \"Hello World\" message. For the frontend, create a basic React component that fetches the message from the backend and displays it on the screen.\n\n7. Set up a testing framework, like Jest, for both the frontend and backend. Write a basic test for each part of the application to ensure the testing setup is working correctly.\n\n8. Configure a CI/CD pipeline for your project. You can use platforms like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD to automate the process. This will ensure your code is tested and deployed automatically whenever you push changes to the repository.\n\n9. Create a comprehensive README file for your project that explains the purpose of the application, the technology stack used, how to set up the project locally, and how to contribute to the project.\n\n10. Start developing features based on the requirements and features you've identified in the previous discussions. Use an agile development approach and create tasks for each feature or enhancement.\n\nAs you progress through the project, remember to regularly commit your changes, write detailed commit messages, and maintain up-to-date documentation.
