Hopefully you can see the topics that I've spoken with you about so far and have an idea of what I'm like as a person and what I am looking for.\n\nI am tech literate.\n\nFinancials\n-I live in the UK and earn ~£40,000 per year\n-I save between £500 and £1000 a month at the moment - I could save my bank statements in an accessible location for you. I have £13,493 saved in my instant savings account at the moment. I would be happy to round down to £13,000 and use the £493 as a 'test' as I genuinely believe that this is one of the biggest world changing technologies and we are literally only at the beginning.\n-I live fairly 'frugally' by most standards - I am not interested in holidays, I don't smoke or drink, I am quite happy living by myself with my pets.\n\n-My ideal start\n\t-I would like to live in a detached house so that I can have a room for drumming without annoying anybody\n\t-I would like the ability to prototype and develop my own series of drum pedals\n\t-I am working on improving my life - I have taken the first step and had the confidence to apply for medical cannabis in the UK. I have been accepted for this and know that I now have the confidence and drive to take things forward. I know that I have potential that is not being realised at the moment. I would love to be financially independent which would allow me to do things that I enjoy doing. These would also have benefit for those that I care about. I would like to find a partner to share this with lol.\n\nCould we start by you helping me to export my ClickUp spaces to a file so that I can upload it for you to see please?
