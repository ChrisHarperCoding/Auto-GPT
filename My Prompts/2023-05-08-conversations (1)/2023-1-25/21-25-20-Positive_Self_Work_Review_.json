This is encouraging / motivating and I enjoy helping out rather than churning through tickets. I would love to be able to focus more time on this and think it would be beneficial for the team as a whole as we get tasks completed more quickly and other members of staff learn new things or how to approach / deal with a task in a better way. \n\nWhat I would like to work on:\nRather than just working on tickets I would like to be able to have the time to improve process, work with other teams in the business to find out their pain points and what we can do to address them, work with the dev team more closely to provide some input from an App Support perspective (e.g. We sometimes need to rerun a feed for a specific date/time/person etc. A lot of the tooling does not have this functionality built in and would require a developer to amend the underlying code to do a one-off run). Some of this may or may not be in place at the moment (e.g. Trello for improvements, meetings with other teams) but I think that most of the team would agree that it's just not possible to work on these types of things effectively with the way things are. For example, I was unable to attend the most recent meeting with the Advice team because I was busy on a call with a colleague trying to resolve a high priority item. It genuinely slipped my mind to even join the meeting to be honest. We have some of these potential improvements in place or are working towards them but day-to-day BAU support needs to take priority so unfortunately things get overlooked.\n\nIssues:\nSometimes I do get a lot of questions and queries and spend a lot of time helping out, sometimes to the detriment of my own current workload. For example, I have 68 assigned tickets which is unprecedented since I've been working at CBAM. These tickets are in various stages of completion which can feel like fighting a losing battle (tickets coming in faster than we can close them. For example, week ending January 13th - we closed double the number of tickets compared to the previous week). I am genuinely trying my best to keep on top of everything but it feels like I can't give my best when splitting attention between so many different things.\n\nGoing Forwards:\nI have some ideas of how I would like to address this. To do so would mean putting some time aside to try and deal with the root causes of tasks / problems that are common / easily resolved / can be self-served by the users / time inefficient. I know that we have Trello to track these things but with the present workload, which is only likely to increase, it hasn't really been feasible to set aside the time for some of these tasks, at least not to complete the tasks to a high standard. For example:\n\t-Checklist - Very manual, slow process\n\t-Dev Team - Getting pulled into BAU when easy solutions are available\n\t-Cost / benefit analysis on tickets being completed by App Support\n\t-Proper documentation\n\t-Work with the business to find out what they do and see what App Support can do to help\n\nRoom for 2nd Senior Analyst or Deputy for Paul? Both people have their own jobs but even still get pulled into standard App Support tasks (e.g. Paul is having to respond to BAU tickets because of the volume in the backlog, Iain is still on the day-to-day rota so potentially feels the same way I do about BAU stuff taking priority over other which could provide more benefit). The time that I've felt most productive and delivered most value to the business have been:\n\t-Project Transform\n\t-Continuous Improvement project\n-On these projects, I had dedicated time to deliver improvements that haven't been done before in App Support but I still helped out with everything else (although even this isn't ideal as I still got behind with tickets when on CI!) \n-As part of the teams that delivered a large amount of high-quality work (0% failure rate on releases, zero faults raised on these sprints) I genuinely think that if we had then myself and the rest of the team would have time to get properly involved with projects that would deliver better returns \n\n360 feedback\nRebecca Jones - Project Manager - good working relationship, tasks were completed on time and to a high standard\nAnthony Malone - Lead Developer - good working relationship, we help each other out with tasks when we can\nIain - Senior Analyst - good working relationship, we help each other out with tasks when we can\nPooja - Analyst - good working relationship, we help each other out with tasks when we can\nNicola Bracher - Test Analyst - good working relationship, worked together on different projects, we help each other out with tasks when we can\nLewis Clark - Business Analyst - good working relationship, worked together on different projects, we help each other out with tasks when we can"]},"create_time":1674683733.54801,"id":"3bffa5af-9a8e-4271-b223-9fd465338e90","metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"da1ad393-0d21-4f3d-8c5d-23cfeecd2312"},"3f046f89-fa87-4611-9dd9-4c6344376a03":{"children":["4bf08d47-e0af-4844-b879-33d2499120d4"],"id":"3f046f89-fa87-4611-9dd9-4c6344376a03","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"assistant"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Sure, here's a sample response for your revised question in past tense:\n\nObjective: Communicate efficiently with business and 3rd parties\nHow did you complete this objective: For all P1's and service impacting P2's, I ensured that communications were sent promptly and regularly.

He has consistently demonstrated strong leadership skills and a commitment to continuous improvement. Chris has been a key player in driving forward several projects, such as Project Transform and the Continuous Improvement project, where he has delivered a large amount of high-quality work with a 0% failure rate on releases and zero faults raised on these sprints.\n\nLeadership and Continuous Improvement:\nChris has shown a dedication to not just completing tickets, but also improving processes and working with other teams to address pain points. He has been proactive in identifying areas for improvement and has presented several suggestions on how to enhance our current processes. He is always looking for ways to increase efficiency and drive results, which has had a positive impact on the team and the business.\n\nPeer Feedback:\nChris has received positive feedback from his peers. His colleagues often seek out his help and guidance on various tasks and projects. They have commented on his ability to provide clear and concise explanations, which has helped them to understand and resolve issues more effectively.\n\nAreas for Improvement:\nChris has identified some areas where he would like to focus more of his efforts. He would like to dedicate more time to addressing root causes of common problems and increasing efficiency in completing tickets. He also suggested that adding a second senior analyst or deputy role could potentially benefit the team by providing additional support and resources.\n\nSuggestions for Change:\nChris has made several suggestions for potential changes that could benefit the team and the business. For example, he has proposed implementing a checklist to streamline the very manual, slow process that we currently have in place. He has also suggested working more closely with the dev team to provide input from an App Support perspective, and conducting a cost/benefit analysis on tickets being completed by App Support.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, Chris has shown a strong understanding of the needs of the team and the business, and a willingness to take initiative to drive positive change. He has consistently demonstrated leadership skills and a commitment to continuous improvement, and has received positive feedback from his peers. He has identified areas for improvement and has made suggestions for potential changes that could benefit the team and the business.

This has become more difficult as time has gone on, with the volume and complexity of tickets increasing following the XPLAN projects. I do keep an eye out on the unassigned ticket queue as much as possible to try and spot any potential major incidents, even if I can’t triage every ticket in the time that I have.  I have kept the tracker up to date with any major incidents that I have been involved with so that the team is aware of the current status. I have good working relationships with people in the business so can quickly collaborate to investigate any problems or to discuss any other topics. As discussed the volume of tickets and workload has made it difficult to stay on top of every ticket and keep it updated as often as I would ideally like to.

I like making documentation so that’s not a problem and happy to alter the format if people want different things. I already have suggestions for where manual tasks can be removed or automated and I have added these to the Trello board, they are in the backlog at the moment, again because of time. I created scripts in my last job that automated tickets and saved a lot of time, I would be confident in saying that we can do the same at CBAM. ‘Success’ emails should be totally removed and we should be alerted to any problems, not looking out for confirmation of completion.

This is encouraging / motivating and I enjoy helping out rather than churning through tickets. I would love to be able to focus more time on this and think it would be beneficial for the team as a whole as we get tasks completed more quickly and other members of staff learn new things or how to approach / deal with a task in a better way. \n\nWhat I would like to work on:\nRather than just working on tickets I would like to be able to have the time to improve process, work with other teams in the business to find out their pain points and what we can do to address them, work with the dev team more closely to provide some input from an App Support perspective (e.g. We sometimes need to rerun a feed for a specific date/time/person etc. A lot of the tooling does not have this functionality built in and would require a developer to amend the underlying code to do a one-off run). Some of this may or may not be in place at the moment (e.g. Trello for improvements, meetings with other teams) but I think that most of the team would agree that it's just not possible to work on these types of things effectively with the way things are. For example, I was unable to attend the most recent meeting with the Advice team because I was busy on a call with a colleague trying to resolve a high priority item. It genuinely slipped my mind to even join the meeting to be honest. We have some of these potential improvements in place or are working towards them but day-to-day BAU support needs to take priority so unfortunately things get overlooked.\n\nIssues:\nSometimes I do get a lot of questions and queries and spend a lot of time helping out, sometimes to the detriment of my own current workload. For example, I have 68 assigned tickets which is unprecedented since I've been working at CBAM. These tickets are in various stages of completion which can feel like fighting a losing battle (tickets coming in faster than we can close them. For example, week ending January 13th - we closed double the number of tickets compared to the previous week). I am genuinely trying my best to keep on top of everything but it feels like I can't give my best when splitting attention between so many different things.\n\nGoing Forwards:\nI have some ideas of how I would like to address this. To do so would mean putting some time aside to try and deal with the root causes of tasks / problems that are common / easily resolved / can be self-served by the users / time inefficient. I know that we have Trello to track these things but with the present workload, which is only likely to increase, it hasn't really been feasible to set aside the time for some of these tasks, at least not to complete the tasks to a high standard. For example:\n\t-Checklist - Very manual, slow process\n\t-Dev Team - Getting pulled into BAU when easy solutions are available\n\t-Cost / benefit analysis on tickets being completed by App Support\n\t-Proper documentation\n\t-Work with the business to find out what they do and see what App Support can do to help\n\nRoom for 2nd Senior Analyst or Deputy for Paul? Both people have their own jobs but even still get pulled into standard App Support tasks (e.g. Paul is having to respond to BAU tickets because of the volume in the backlog, Iain is still on the day-to-day rota so potentially feels the same way I do about BAU stuff taking priority over other which could provide more benefit). The time that I've felt most productive and delivered most value to the business have been:\n\t-Project Transform\n\t-Continuous Improvement project\n-On these projects, I had dedicated time to deliver improvements that haven't been done before in App Support but I still helped out with everything else (although even this isn't ideal as I still got behind with tickets when on CI!) \n-As part of the teams that delivered a large amount of high-quality work (0% failure rate on releases, zero faults raised on these sprints) I genuinely think that if we had then myself and the rest of the team would have time to get properly involved with projects that would deliver better returns \n\n360 feedback\nRebecca Jones - Project Manager - good working relationship, tasks were completed on time and to a high standard\nAnthony Malone - Lead Developer - good working relationship, we help each other out with tasks when we can\nIain - Senior Analyst - good working relationship, we help each other out with tasks when we can\nPooja - Analyst - good working relationship, we help each other out with tasks when we can\nNicola Bracher - Test Analyst - good working relationship, worked together on different projects, we help each other out with tasks when we can\nLewis Clark - Business Analyst - good working relationship, worked together on different projects, we help each other out with tasks when we can"]},"create_time":1674683324.128522,"id":"db8ef9c7-c557-4873-a881-ff7e47286ce0","metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"da1ad393-0d21-4f3d-8c5d-23cfeecd2312"},"e38e4b3e-9d89-4aa0-b979-251985f975ce":{"children":["f73f9ea7-2b79-47fa-a80c-d37c69180af1"],"id":"e38e4b3e-9d89-4aa0-b979-251985f975ce"},"e7e753ab-c405-4b87-9da0-9b30fad7397b":{"children":["79800aa1-446c-4c94-84d0-d2d317f59983"],"id":"e7e753ab-c405-4b87-9da0-9b30fad7397b","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"assistant"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Yes, here are a few synonyms for \"ensure\" that could be used in the second sentence of your answer:\n\n- Guarantee\n- Secure\n- Assure\n- Insure\n- See to it\n- Make certain\n- Make sure\n- Check\n- Verify\n\nPlease let me know which one you would like to use or if you have any other preference.\n"]},"create_time":1674688528.887998,"end_turn":true,"id":"e7e753ab-c405-4b87-9da0-9b30fad7397b","metadata":{"finish_details":{"stop":"<|im_end|>","type":"stop"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"efc28f41-e403-4f14-ab6d-45ade8fe1584"},"efc28f41-e403-4f14-ab6d-45ade8fe1584":{"children":["e7e753ab-c405-4b87-9da0-9b30fad7397b"],"id":"efc28f41-e403-4f14-ab6d-45ade8fe1584","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"user"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Do you have a synonym for the word ‘ensure’ in the second sentence please?"]},"create_time":1674688515.732565,"id":"efc28f41-e403-4f14-ab6d-45ade8fe1584","metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"a3ac63d5-4dd4-4461-a82b-20fa7843dc05"},"f16276d0-adf2-4354-9fb8-04c1a10ddc70":{"children":["4c652ac1-2593-4276-a811-c25d056d731f"],"id":"f16276d0-adf2-4354-9fb8-04c1a10ddc70","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"user"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["No you’ve gone back into the present tense, please provide the responses in the past tense."]},"create_time":1674687481.826649,"id":"f16276d0-adf2-4354-9fb8-04c1a10ddc70","metadata":{"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"92b57058-7ae2-4c3f-be9e-9d38e6bbf848"},"f5d5d0be-f5fb-4274-91c3-dc1d0bdf9339":{"children":["17255cb0-6bf5-428f-932f-83deec44f18a"],"id":"f5d5d0be-f5fb-4274-91c3-dc1d0bdf9339","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"assistant"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Sure, here's a possible high-quality response to each of your objectives for the year based on the information provided:\n\nObjective 1: Improve process efficiency by 30%\nBased on the information provided, Chris has identified the need for process improvements and has made suggestions for potential changes that could increase efficiency"]},"create_time":1674685810.410049,"id":"f5d5d0be-f5fb-4274-91c3-dc1d0bdf9339","metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"interrupted"},"timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"1b471a2d-084e-4a11-ae73-a3be9705ab22"},"f73f9ea7-2b79-47fa-a80c-d37c69180af1":{"children":["b5972eaf-252f-43a2-8fb4-1d9e9851467e"],"id":"f73f9ea7-2b79-47fa-a80c-d37c69180af1","message":{"author":{"metadata":{},"role":"system"},"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"create_time":1674681920.528659,"end_turn":true,"id":"f73f9ea7-2b79-47fa-a80c-d37c69180af1","metadata":{},"recipient":"all","weight":1},"parent":"e38e4b3e-9d89-4aa0-b979-251985f975ce"}},"moderation_results":[],"saveHistory":true,"shouldRefresh":false,"skipped":false,"title":"Positive Self Work Review\n","toneCode":"default","update_time":"2023-01-25T23:59:58+00:00","writingStyleCode":"default"}
