Please show me a recipe so that I can make millies style soft chocolate chip cookies at home. I would like to use 200g of butter and split this into 16 portions please 

## ASSISTANT
Sure, here's a recipe for Millie's style soft chocolate chip cookies using 200g of butter and yielding 16 cookies:

Ingredients:
- 200g unsalted butter, softened
- 150g light brown sugar
- 100g granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 300g all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 250g chocolate chips (milk, dark, or a mix, according to your preference)

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, light brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. You can use a hand mixer, stand mixer, or just a wooden spoon for this step.

3. Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture, and mix until well combined.

4. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.

5. Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

6. Divide the dough into 16 equal portions (roughly 65g each). Roll each portion into a ball and place it on the prepared baking sheets, ensuring there is enough space between them for the cookies to spread as they bake (at least 2 inches apart).

7. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden and the centers are still soft. Be careful not to overbake them, as this will make the cookies less soft and chewy.

8. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your homemade Millie's style soft chocolate chip cookies!

- 1/2 tsp salt

1. Preheat your fan oven to 160°C (320°F) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

I would like to make the cookies extra special. I was going to add a teaspoon of golden syrup, would this be a good idea? Please suggest other tricks to make them as good as possible 

## ASSISTANT
Adding a teaspoon of golden syrup is a great idea! It will enhance the flavor and add a touch of extra chewiness to the cookies. Here are some other suggestions to make your cookies extra special:

1. Add a teaspoon of golden syrup to the wet ingredients as suggested.

2. Use high-quality chocolate chips or chop your favorite chocolate bar into chunks. Using a mix of milk, dark, and white chocolate can also add depth of flavor and make the cookies more interesting.

3. Sprinkle a pinch of sea salt on top of the cookies before baking. The salt enhances the sweetness and adds a pleasant contrast in taste.

4. For an extra burst of flavor, you can also add 1/2 teaspoon of instant espresso powder or a teaspoon of strong brewed coffee to the wet ingredients. Coffee complements chocolate beautifully and deepens its flavor.

5. Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of almond or hazelnut extract to the dough, in addition to the vanilla extract. This will give the cookies a nutty aroma and a more complex flavor profile.

6. Mix in some chopped nuts, like walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts, to give the cookies a delightful crunch and enhance the flavor. Use about 1/2 cup of chopped nuts.

7. For a festive touch, you can also add 1/2 cup of dried fruit such as cranberries or cherries, which pairs well with chocolate.

8. Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes before baking. This helps the cookies maintain their shape and allows the flavors to meld together.

Feel free to incorporate any of these ideas into the recipe I provided earlier, and enjoy your extra special Millie's style soft chocolate chip cookies!

## ASSISTANT
Apologies for that. I've adjusted the recipe to include metric measurements for the suggested additions:

2. Use high-quality chocolate chips or chop your favorite chocolate bar into chunks. Using a mix of milk, dark, and white chocolate can also add depth of flavor and make the cookies more interesting.

3. Sprinkle a pinch of sea salt on top of the cookies before baking. The salt enhances the sweetness and adds a pleasant contrast in taste.

4. For an extra burst of flavor, you can also add 2-3 grams of instant espresso powder or a teaspoon of strong brewed coffee to the wet ingredients. Coffee complements chocolate beautifully and deepens its flavor.

5. Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of almond or hazelnut extract to the dough, in addition to the vanilla extract. This will give the cookies a nutty aroma and a more complex flavor profile.

6. Mix in about 50-75 grams of chopped nuts, like walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts, to give the cookies a delightful crunch and enhance the flavor.

7. For a festive touch, you can also add about 75-100 grams of dried fruit such as cranberries or cherries, which pairs well with chocolate.

I'm in the shop and they have baking powder or bicarbonate of soda which should I use for this recipe please 

## ASSISTANT
For this recipe, you should use bicarbonate of soda, also known as baking soda. Baking soda will help the cookies rise and create a tender texture. Baking powder and baking soda are not interchangeable, as they react differently with other ingredients. So, go ahead and purchase bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) for this recipe.

How do I defrost this cookie quickly please so that it isn't affected? 

## ASSISTANT
To defrost a frozen cookie quickly without affecting its texture, follow these steps:

1. Remove the frozen cookie from its packaging, as leaving it wrapped may cause the cookie to become soggy as it thaws.
2. Place the cookie on a microwave-safe plate.
3. Microwave the cookie at 50% power (or use the defrost setting) for about 10-20 seconds. Check the cookie after 10 seconds, and if it's still slightly frozen, continue to heat it in 5-second intervals. Make sure not to overheat the cookie, as it may become too soft or even burn.
4. Once the cookie has reached your desired temperature, remove it from the microwave and allow it to cool for a few seconds before enjoying it. The cookie should be warm and soft, similar to a freshly baked cookie.

This method allows you to defrost the cookie quickly without affecting its texture or taste. Remember, microwaves can vary in power, so you may need to adjust the defrosting time accordingly.
