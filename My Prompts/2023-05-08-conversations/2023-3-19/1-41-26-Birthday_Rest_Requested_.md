## USER
Hi, I would like to update my whatsapp status to something like 'I want a lie in for my birthday please leave me alone thanks :)' but not sounding negative. Could you come up with a few examples of what such a status could sound like please? Thanks.

## ASSISTANT
Of course! Here are a few options that convey your message in a more positive light:

1. "On my birthday, I'm treating myself to some quiet time. Your love and wishes are appreciated, though! 🥳💤"
2. "Birthday plans: recharging and relaxing! Please send your warm wishes and I'll catch up with you soon! 🎉🛌"
3. "Celebrating my birthday with a cozy day in. Love and good vibes are always welcome! 🎂😴"
4. "It's my birthday! Giving myself the gift of rest. Feel free to send love, but I'll be offline for a bit. 🥰🌙"
5. "For my birthday, I'm indulging in some me-time. Thanks for understanding and sending your love from a distance! 🎈💆‍♀️"

Feel free to choose one or mix and match elements from these examples to create your perfect status!
