Hi,

I am astounded at the capabilities of LLM's and generative AI - I have already used it in real life to actually make improvements already and I have a huge list of things that I can think of doing and want to do.

I am recording my thoughts in 'ClickUp' for Mac.

I am tech literate.

Financials
-I live in the UK and earn ~£40,000 per year
-I save between £500 and £1000 a month at the moment - I could save my bank statements in an accessible location for you. I have £13,493 saved in my instant savings account at the moment. I would be happy to round down to £13,000 and use the £493 as a 'test' as I genuinely believe that this is one of the biggest world changing technologies and we are literally only at the beginning.
-I live fairly 'frugally' by most standards - I am not interested in holidays, I don't smoke or drink, I am quite happy living by myself with my pets.

-My ideal start
	-I would like to live in a detached house so that I can have a room for drumming without annoying anybody
	-I would like the ability to prototype and develop my own series of drum pedals
	-I am working on improving my life - I have taken the first step and had the confidence to apply for medical cannabis in the UK. I have been accepted for this and know that I now have the confidence and drive to take things forward. I know that I have potential that is not being realised at the moment. I would love to be financially independent which would allow me to do things that I enjoy doing. These would also have benefit for those that I care about. I would like to find a partner to share this with lol. My first thought is investing in Microsoft because even one impact of this (switching entirely away from Google to Bing as my main search engine now) has had a massive impact in such a short time.

One other major thing genuinely has been the topics that Luke LaFreniere has been discussing on the WAN show recently.

Can I create a file on my computer showing the main bits of information that you would find useful to help me with this conversation? I'm using an M2 Max Macbook Pro.

I was thinking of exporting my ClickUp space to a file so that I can upload it for you to see please? 

## ASSISTANT
It's great to hear that you've found value in using LLMs and generative AI! I'm here to help you with any questions or guidance you might need.

Regarding your financial goals and interests, it's important to have a clear plan and consider various aspects, such as investments, savings, and expenses. Since I cannot access your personal files or bank statements, I can provide general advice and guidance based on the information you've shared.

1. Saving and Investing:
With £13,000 in savings and a monthly saving of £500-£1,000, you have a solid foundation to start. It's a good idea to keep an emergency fund of 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in case of unforeseen circumstances. Once you have that established, consider looking into various investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or index funds. Microsoft could be a viable option, but remember to diversify your investments to minimize risk.

2. Housing:
If you're interested in purchasing a detached house, research the property market in your desired area, considering factors like location, price, and potential growth. You may want to work with a real estate agent or a mortgage broker to determine the best course of action.

3. Drum Pedal Business:
To prototype and develop your drum pedals, consider researching the market and competition to understand the potential demand. Developing a business plan and seeking advice from experienced entrepreneurs in the industry will help you make informed decisions.

4. Personal Development:
It's great that you're working on improving your life, and finding the right partner is an important aspect of that journey. Engage in activities and hobbies you're passionate about, as this can increase the chances of meeting like-minded people.

As for sharing your ClickUp space and files, unfortunately, I cannot access or view your files directly. However, you can share the main points or questions from your ClickUp space in the chat, and I'd be happy to help answer them.

Regarding your M1 Max MacBook Pro, you can create a file with the main information you'd like to discuss and save it to your computer. Simply open a text editor or word processing application (such as TextEdit or Microsoft Word) and save the file once you're finished. Although I cannot access the file directly, you can copy and paste relevant information into the chat for us to discuss.

Remember, my advice is general and may not be tailored to your specific situation. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or other experts for personalized guidance.
