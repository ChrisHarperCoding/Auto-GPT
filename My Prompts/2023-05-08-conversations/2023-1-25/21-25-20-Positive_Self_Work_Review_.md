My feelings about the year so far:

Personal:
-I am feeling more confident about myself as people are coming to me more often to ask questions and for feedback. This is encouraging / motivating and I enjoy helping out rather than churning through tickets. I would love to be able to focus more time on this and think it would be beneficial for the team as a whole as we get tasks completed more quickly and other members of staff learn new things or how to approach / deal with a task in a better way. 

What I would like to work on:
Rather than just working on tickets I would like to be able to have the time to improve process, work with other teams in the business to find out their pain points and what we can do to address them, work with the dev team more closely to provide some input from an App Support perspective (e.g. We sometimes need to rerun a feed for a specific date/time/person etc. A lot of the tooling does not have this functionality built in and would require a developer to amend the underlying code to do a one-off run). Some of this may or may not be in place at the moment (e.g. Trello for improvements, meetings with other teams) but I think that most of the team would agree that it's just not possible to work on these types of things effectively with the way things are. For example, I was unable to attend the most recent meeting with the Advice team because I was busy on a call with a colleague trying to resolve a high priority item. It genuinely slipped my mind to even join the meeting to be honest. We have some of these potential improvements in place or are working towards them but day-to-day BAU support needs to take priority so unfortunately things get overlooked.

Issues:
Sometimes I do get a lot of questions and queries and spend a lot of time helping out, sometimes to the detriment of my own current workload. For example, I have 68 assigned tickets which is unprecedented since I've been working at CBAM. These tickets are in various stages of completion which can feel like fighting a losing battle (tickets coming in faster than we can close them. For example, week ending January 13th - we closed double the number of tickets compared to the previous week). I am genuinely trying my best to keep on top of everything but it feels like I can't give my best when splitting attention between so many different things.

Going Forwards:
I have some ideas of how I would like to address this. To do so would mean putting some time aside to try and deal with the root causes of tasks / problems that are common / easily resolved / can be self-served by the users / time inefficient. I know that we have Trello to track these things but with the present workload, which is only likely to increase, it hasn't really been feasible to set aside the time for some of these tasks, at least not to complete the tasks to a high standard. For example:
	-Checklist - Very manual, slow process
	-Dev Team - Getting pulled into BAU when easy solutions are available
	-Cost / benefit analysis on tickets being completed by App Support
	-Proper documentation
	-Work with the business to find out what they do and see what App Support can do to help

Room for 2nd Senior Analyst or Deputy for Paul? Both people have their own jobs but even still get pulled into standard App Support tasks (e.g. Paul is having to respond to BAU tickets because of the volume in the backlog, Iain is still on the day-to-day rota so potentially feels the same way I do about BAU stuff taking priority over other which could provide more benefit). The time that I've felt most productive and delivered most value to the business have been:
	-Project Transform
	-Continuous Improvement project
-On these projects, I had dedicated time to deliver improvements that haven't been done before in App Support but I still helped out with everything else (although even this isn't ideal as I still got behind with tickets when on CI!) 
-As part of the teams that delivered a large amount of high-quality work (0% failure rate on releases, zero faults raised on these sprints) I genuinely think that if we had then myself and the rest of the team would have time to get properly involved with projects that would deliver better returns 

360 feedback
Rebecca Jones - Project Manager - good working relationship, tasks were completed on time and to a high standard
Anthony Malone - Lead Developer - good working relationship, we help each other out with tasks when we can
Iain - Senior Analyst - good working relationship, we help each other out with tasks when we can
Pooja - Analyst - good working relationship, we help each other out with tasks when we can
Nicola Bracher - Test Analyst - good working relationship, worked together on different projects, we help each other out with tasks when we can
Lewis Clark - Business Analyst - good working relationship, worked together on different projects, we help each other out with tasks when we can

My answer - For all major incidents I ensured that comms were sent promptly and on a suitable interval. These comms were tailored for each incident to ensure that the language and information included was appropriate and to provide as much relevant detail as possible. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to complete the maintenance of the Major Incident comms lists. I did make some amendments to the groups to refresh the recipient list but a top down review has not been possible.

Question - Embed new technology and tools into the team. Evaluate SolarWinds, customising it to effectively monitor the on-premises IRESS stack. Build out capability using TOAD/SQL, creating a repository of scripts and useful queries that can be documented and made available across the team.

My information on these tasks: SolarWinds evaluation on the backlog, not had time. I have successfully implemented other monitoring applications in my past roles but at that company I was not given the time to take this to the next level. I think that we can use SolarWinds to monitor the on-premises applications it just needs planning properly, properly writing up and tested. I like making documentation so that’s not a problem and happy to alter the format if people want different things. I already have suggestions for where manual tasks can be removed or automated and I have added these to the Trello board, they are in the backlog at the moment, again because of time. I created scripts in my last job that automated tickets and saved a lot of time, I would be confident in saying that we can do the same at CBAM. ‘Success’ emails should be totally removed and we should be alerted to any problems, not looking out for confirmation of completion. Could have a dashboard as a backup. I would enjoy being the person to enquire about the monitoring and tailoring it to our team’s needs.

Question - When on primary support ensure that incidents are picked up promptly and managed through to completion. P1/P2 tickets to be assigned within 20 minutes. Ensure tracker is up to date at all times and focus on meeting SLA’s where they exist. Escalate as appropriate within own team, management and third parties. Customer responded to be maintained within 1 business day. Closure codes, effective resolution Details and problem ticket candidacy to be reviewed for all priority tickets.

My answer, please review and amend to provide a high quality answer - I aim to pick up incidents as quickly as possible. This has become more difficult as time has gone on, with the volume and complexity of tickets increasing following the XPLAN projects. I do keep an eye out on the unassigned ticket queue as much as possible to try and spot any potential major incidents, even if I can’t triage every ticket in the time that I have.  I have kept the tracker up to date with any major incidents that I have been involved with so that the team is aware of the current status. I have good working relationships with people in the business so can quickly collaborate to investigate any problems or to discuss any other topics. As discussed the volume of tickets and workload has made it difficult to stay on top of every ticket and keep it updated as often as I would ideally like to.  Aim to include as much relevant information as possible on priority tickets to ensure that anyone reviewing the details can pick up if required.

Question - remove wastage in the team

Answer - I have multiple ongoing service improvement tasks on the go and have submitted additional tasks onto the Trello board to pick up when capacity allows. I feel that we should document each type of task or activity as we encounter it which would take time and effort initially but would reap benefits in the long run versus firefighting.
