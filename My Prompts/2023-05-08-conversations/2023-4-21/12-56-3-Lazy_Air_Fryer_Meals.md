## USER
I'm really lazy for cooking / eating and I know I need to improve this

Could we come up with a meal plan that I can follow for the month that gives me all I require?

Preferably stuff I can keep in the freezer or stuff that lasts a long time so I'm not going the shop all the time? I have an air fryer as well and that's been great so as much use of that as possible please? 

## ASSISTANT
Of course! Here's a simple and flexible meal plan for the month that requires minimal shopping trips, focuses on freezer-friendly ingredients, and makes good use of your air fryer. This plan is designed around three meals a day, each with a protein source, a vegetable, and a carbohydrate. You can mix and match as you prefer.

Protein sources (pick one per meal):
1. Frozen chicken breasts
2. Frozen salmon fillets
3. Frozen shrimp
4. Frozen ground turkey or beef
5. Canned beans (black beans, kidney beans, chickpeas, etc.)
6. Canned tuna or salmon
7. Tofu (can be frozen and thawed when needed)

Vegetables (pick one per meal):
1. Frozen broccoli
2. Frozen green beans
3. Frozen mixed vegetables
4. Frozen spinach
5. Frozen bell pepper strips
6. Frozen cauliflower
7. Frozen Brussels sprouts

Carbohydrates (pick one per meal):
1. Brown or white rice (can be cooked in bulk and frozen in portions)
2. Quinoa (can also be cooked in bulk and frozen)
3. Sweet potatoes (store in a cool, dry place)
4. Whole wheat pasta (cook as needed)
5. Whole wheat bread (can be frozen and thawed when needed)
6. Frozen whole grain waffles
7. Couscous (quick-cooking)
